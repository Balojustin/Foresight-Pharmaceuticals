# Foresight Pharmaceuticals
### by Folami Balogun

Foresight Pharmaceuticals is one of the leading Pharmaceutical Manufacturing companies with a global presence.

Their Markets are divided into different regions across the world. One of those regions manages the Germany and Poland Markets.  
Foresight Pharmaceuticals is hoping to enable its distributors gain some insights up to the retail level using this data. 

## About the dataset
>The [Foresight Pharmaceuticals dataset](https://foresightbi.com.ng/practice-data/3-datasets-for-your-portfolio/) contains 254,082 observations and 18 fields. The description of each field is provided in the first worksheet. The dataset contains sales data, from 2017 up to 2020.

## Data processing
> After downloading the dataset and viewing in excel, I observed the dataset was majorly tidy and clean already. There were no missing rows, each column represented a field and each row represented an observation.

> I loaded the dataset into power query. I changed the sales datatype from general to currency. I also created a new column which merged the month and year column together which I used to create a calendar table using data analysis expressions (DAX) in Power BI. I also removed duplicate data (4) from the dataset.

## Key Insights
>Total revenue generated during the time given time period was 11.80 billion with Germany accounting for 11.12 billion of this. 

>Poland only had sales data recorded for 2018. 

> West Germany with cities such as Frankfurt, Dortmund, Dusseldorf, Cologne, Stuggart generated the most revenue. 

>The revenue generated peaked in 2018 after which a continuous decline in generated revenue per year was observed.  

> Of the 6 product classes, the analgesics were the top grossing products with Ionclotide (an analgesic) being the most valuable product of all the 249 products.

> At the retail level, the pharmacy channel generates more revenue compared to the hospital channel. The retail sub channel accounts for 28.3% of the total revenue generated and is the highest grossing sub channel.

> One other key observation is the revenue generated was directly proportional to the number of distributors.
